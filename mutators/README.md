# Mutators

Mutation engines for generating code mutations across different programming languages.

## Contents

- **mutator.py**: Core helper that applies configured regex mutations to a
  repository checkout.
- **Python**: (future) Python-specific mutation operators
- **JavaScript**: (future) JS/TS mutation support
- **Common**: (future) Language-agnostic utilities and shared mutation logic

## Purpose

Generate artificial bugs (mutations) in code to test the effectiveness of existing test suites.
