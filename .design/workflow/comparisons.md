Prompt:

```
So you compared Argo Workflows vs Temporal. Is there any other candidates? (e.g. GitHub Actions, something AWS provides, something Azure provides, etc.)
```

Answer:

# Workflow Orchestration Options for Tinybug.ai

This document compares various workflow orchestration solutions for Tinybug.ai — which requires long-running, multi-tenant, pause/resume-capable workflows that interact with external CI systems (like GitHub Actions or Buildkite).

---

## ✅ Recommended: **Temporal**

[Temporal](https://temporal.io) is a highly resilient, code-first workflow engine ideal for long-running service orchestrations like Tinybug’s test effectiveness measurement.

---

## 🔍 Other Candidates Considered

### 🟡 AWS Step Functions

**Description**: Serverless orchestration engine on AWS; state machines defined in JSON/YAML.

- ✅ Fully managed, integrates with AWS services
- ✅ Supports step retries, failure handling
- ❌ Declarative (not code-first)
- ❌ Weak multi-tenancy
- ❌ Poor integration with external CI (e.g., GitHub Actions)
- ❌ Observability limited vs. Temporal
- ⚠️ Cost grows with step count + duration

**Verdict**: Good if you're fully AWS-native. Not ideal for Tinybug's multi-tenant, external-CI-heavy setup.

---

### 🟡 GitHub Actions

**Description**: GitHub’s built-in CI/CD engine using `.github/workflows/*.yml`.

- ✅ Zero infra if using GitHub
- ✅ Native for test runs and PR-based triggers
- ❌ Not a general-purpose workflow engine
- ❌ No native pause/resume, long-running state, or multi-tenancy
- ❌ Tied to GitHub (not extensible to GitLab, etc.)

**Verdict**: Good for *triggering* tests, not for *coordinating* workflows. Could be a component but not the main engine.

---

### 🟡 Prefect

**Description**: Python-native orchestration engine designed for data workflows.

- ✅ Python code-first, low setup cost
- ✅ Lightweight and developer-friendly
- ⚠️ Limited maturity for long-running, service-level orchestrations
- ⚠️ Multi-tenancy support not first-class
- ⚠️ Weak support for external CI integration

**Verdict**: Usable for lightweight jobs. Not robust enough for Tinybug’s complex needs.

---

### 🟡 Azure Durable Functions / Google Workflows

**Description**: Cloud-native workflow engines tied to their respective cloud ecosystems.

- ✅ Managed, scalable
- ✅ Native cloud service integration
- ❌ Declarative
- ❌ Poor support for multi-tenancy
- ❌ Weak integration with external CI
- ❌ Not designed for long-running code-based workflows

**Verdict**: Good for simple flows within their clouds. Not flexible or extensible enough for Tinybug.

---

### 🟡 Cadence (Uber)

**Description**: Open-source predecessor of Temporal.

- ✅ Feature-rich, proven at scale
- ❌ Less active than Temporal
- ❌ Harder to set up and operate
- ❌ Temporal is essentially Cadence v2

**Verdict**: Use Temporal instead — it's Cadence’s successor with stronger community and tooling.

## 🟢 Summary

**Use Temporal** — preferably **Temporal Cloud** — to orchestrate Tinybug’s test effectiveness measurement workflows.

It gives you:
- Durable, resumable workflows
- Code-first orchestration (not YAML/JSON)
- First-class multi-tenancy via namespaces
- Seamless integration with GitHub Actions, Buildkite, etc.
- Strong observability and developer experience
- Low infrastructure burden
