Prompt:

```
give me a detailed PoC milestone plan with timeline and deliverables
```

Answer: 

# Tinybug.ai PoC Milestone Plan

## Overview

Focus:  
- Mutation testing proof of concept for one language (Python or Golang)  
- Simple mutators, integration with GitHub Actions  
- Use Temporal Cloud for workflow orchestration  
- Basic results UI for a single tenant

## Milestones & Timeline

| Milestone                       | Duration | Deliverables                                   | Description                                      |
|--------------------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Project Setup & Research** | 1 week   | - PoC repo scaffold<br>- Select language (Python or Golang)<br>- Evaluate mutator libs (MutPy, Go mutator, etc.)<br>- Temporal Cloud account setup | Prepare foundations, confirm tooling and environment choices |
| **2. Mutation Generation Prototype** | 2 weeks  | - Working mutator generating simple mutants<br>- Mutation applied to test repo branch<br>- Ability to generate ~10 mutants per run | Implement basic mutation logic using existing libs or simple custom mutators |
| **3. GitHub Actions Integration** | 1 week   | - GitHub Actions workflow triggered by PR<br>- Tests run on mutated code branches<br>- Collect test pass/fail results | Set up CI pipeline to run tests on mutants and report results |
| **4. Temporal Workflow Orchestration** | 2 weeks  | - Temporal workflows orchestrating outer and inner loops<br>- Outer loop: coverage & mutant enumeration<br>- Inner loop: create PR, trigger tests, fetch results, analyze<br>- Basic error handling and retry | Implement the long-running measurement orchestration on Temporal |
| **5. Result Aggregation & Basic UI** | 1 week   | - Simple web UI or CLI<br>- Show overall mutation score<br>- List mutants with pass/fail<br>- View mutant details (diff + test results) | Provide minimal user interface to present results to the tenant |
| **6. Basic Tenant Setup**       | 1 week   | - Support single tenant namespace in Temporal<br>- Tenant-specific URLs (e.g., `/poctenant`)<br>- Basic access control enforcement | Implement minimal multi-tenancy support for the PoC |
| **7. Testing & Validation**     | 1 week   | - End-to-end test runs<br>- Validate mutation scoring accuracy<br>- Verify Temporal workflowsâ€™ resilience | Test the PoC system and fix issues |
| **8. Documentation & Demo**     | 1 week   | - PoC documentation<br>- Demo script<br>- Prepare for stakeholder review | Finalize docs and demo materials |

## Total Duration: ~10 weeks

## Notes

- Timeline can be compressed if resources allow.  
- Priority is working end-to-end flow, even if parts are minimal or hardcoded.  
- Focus on ease of iteration for MVP phase.  
- Can swap out GitHub Actions for another CI in MVP.  
- Mutators kept simple initially, extensible later.
