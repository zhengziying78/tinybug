The `.design` folder is temporary. I use AI to help me do the design, plan, etc. I keep what AI generates in this folder. Content in this folder can be also used as input for furhter AI collaboration. 

----- Here is a TL;DR -----

## What's in the .plan folder

**PoC/**: 10-week proof of concept plan for mutation testing with Python/pytest, GitHub Actions, Temporal Cloud orchestration, and basic web UI

**Temporal/**: Decision to use Temporal Cloud over Argo Workflows for long-running, multi-tenant workflow orchestration with namespace isolation

**Web/**: Full-stack architecture with Next.js frontend (Vercel), FastAPI backend (Fly.io), PostgreSQL (Supabase), and tenant-specific URLs

**Security/**: Secrets management strategy using Doppler/AWS Secrets Manager across dev/staging/prod environments

**Random/**: Miscellaneous thoughts and considerations for the project
